You need a time series of catchment volumes to be routed. The volumes should be in units of meters cubed and have a
uniform time step for all rivers with no missing values. There are 2 likely ways that you can get this information.

1. Generate it directly using a hydrological model.
2. Generate runoff depth grids and use GIS to calculate zonal statistics to get the catchment volumes.
